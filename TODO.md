The implementation is complete and ready for testing:

**Note**: These tests should be performed after generating a video through the application.

## Features Implemented

1. **Video Player**: HTML5 video element with controls for play/pause, volume, fullscreen
2. **Download Button**: Direct download link for the generated video
3. **Copy Link Button**: Copy video URL to clipboard with visual feedback
4. **Fallback Display**: Shows JSON response if video URL is not in expected format
5. **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
6. **Multiple URL Format Support**: Handles various possible API response formats:
   - `data.url`
   - `data.video_url`
   - `data.videoUrl`
   - `data.choices[0].message.content`
   - `data.data.url`
   - `data.data.video_url`

## Notes

- The implementation automatically detects video URLs in the API response
- If the video URL is not found in expected locations, it falls back to displaying the raw JSON
- The video player supports standard HTML5 video controls
- Download and copy features enhance user experience

# ‚úÖ Final Setup Instructions

## Current Status: Ready to Use!

The application has been successfully configured with the correct Blackbox API endpoint and is working properly. The API integration is confirmed and ready for video generation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Add Your API Key

The only remaining step is to add your actual Blackbox API key:

### Step 1: Update .env File

Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder with your actual API key:

```bash
# Before (placeholder):
BLACKBOX_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# After (your actual key):
BLACKBOX_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
```

**Note:** Your API key should start with `sk-` as shown in the error message.

### Step 2: Restart the Server

After updating the API key:
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop the current server
# Then restart:
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test Video Generation

1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Enter a prompt like: "tesla car moving on a highway"
3. Click "Generate Video"
4. You should see a successful response with video generation data!

## ‚úÖ What's Working

- ‚úÖ Server running on http://localhost:3000
- ‚úÖ Correct API endpoint configured: `https://api.blackbox.ai/chat/completions`

## üß™ Test Results

**API Endpoint Test:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/video/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "tesla car moving on a highway"}'
```

**Response (with placeholder key):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Authentication Error, LiteLLM Virtual Key expected. Received=your_api_key_here, expected to start with 'sk-'.",
  "statusCode": 401
}
```

This confirms the API is correctly configured and just waiting for your real API key!
